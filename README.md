# geoio

This repository was developed in the module GIS Programming @ Hochschule MÃ¼nchen in the WS2017. 

The main purpose was to implement an algorithm, which calculates the complex hull of points and a graphical user interface, which allows to manually create points.

To achive this goals, web technologies are used:

The client side code is written in JavaScript by using the React+Redux Stack, which is represented by this repository.

The server side code is written in Python using the Flask RESTful Framework, which can be found  (here)[https://github.com/sebastianfrey/geoio-server].
